MacPorts today filed an application with Google for Summer of Code 2007. [Summer of Code](https://code.google.com/soc/) is a Google-sponsored program under which students work over the summer on an open source project, gaining valuable experience while also contributing important effort to open source projects.

We'll know by March 14 whether our application has been accepted. We've set up a tracking page at [SummerOfCode](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SummerOfCode) with more information and a list of potential tasks.

Please join us in sending good vibes to google to get our application approved so that we can help students learn while enhancing MacPorts.
