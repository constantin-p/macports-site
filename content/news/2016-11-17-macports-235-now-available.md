The MacPorts Project is pleased to announce the release of version
2.3.5. This is a bugfix release with small changes only, but the first
we cut from our new home at GitHub. See the [ChangeLog][1] for the list
of changes.

If you already have MacPorts installed, the preferred method for
updating is to run:

`sudo port selfupdate`

For new installs, there are also package installers available for 10.12,
10.11, 10.10, 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6, and 10.5 on [our website][2].
These installers and the source tarballs are also available from the
corresponding [v2.3.5 tag on GitHub][3].

Detached PGP signatures for the disk images and package installers have
been made by Joshua Root and the source tarballs have been signed by
Rainer MÃ¼ller. Both public keys are available on the keyservers and our
MacPorts wiki pages ([jmr][4], [raimue][5]), the fingerprints being:


`0x01FF673FB4AAE6CD: C403 7936 5723 6DCF 2E58  0C02 01FF 673F B4AA E6CD`

`0x670191C05C5C6749: 7500 E6A3 6FA5 83B4 071B  B540 6701 91C0 5C5C 6749`
