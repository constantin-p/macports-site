We're very pleased to announce that MacPorts has been selected by Google as an organizational member of Google [Summer of Code 2007](https://code.google.com/soc/). This means that students may apply to work on MacPorts projects through the Summer of Code program sponsored by Google. Compensation for completion of a project is $4500 to the student, and $500 to MacPorts.

The members of the MacPorts portmgr team and community are excited by this opportunity to improve MacPorts while also welcoming new contributors to the MacPorts ecosystem.

For more information, please see the MacPorts [tracking page](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SummerOfCode) for summer of code.

We encourage qualified and interested students to apply!
