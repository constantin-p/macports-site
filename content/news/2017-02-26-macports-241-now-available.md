The MacPorts Project is pleased to announce the release of version
2.4.1. This is a bugfix release with small changes only. See the
[ChangeLog][1] for the list of changes.

If you already have MacPorts installed, the preferred method for
updating is to run:

`sudo port selfupdate`

For new installs, there are also [package installers][2] available for 10.12,
10.11, 10.10, 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 and 10.5 (10.6 is universal i386/x86\_64; 10.5 is i386/ppc, the rest are x86\_64).
The source is also available as tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2, or from the [git tag][3].

Detached PGP signatures for the disk images, packages and source
tarballs have been made by Joshua Root, whose public key is available on the
keyservers and the [MacPorts wiki][4], the fingerprint being:

`0x01FF673FB4AAE6CD: C403 7936 5723 6DCF 2E58  0C02 01FF 673F B4AA E6CD`
