As of 14 October, 2008, MacPorts has undergone a change of management. The email announcement can be found at:

<https://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2008-October/011899.html>

The first order of business (once getting settled in is complete) is to put the final wraps on a 1.7.0 release and have a beta1 version out soon. This will be a big release, as it has been quite some time since 1.6.0. There is a milestone for 1.7.0 tickets on Trac:

<https://trac.macports.org/milestone/MacPorts%201.7.0>

However, many other changes have been made without tickets, and the entire set of updates is in the ChangeLog:

<https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/base/ChangeLog>

It is quite a list since 1.6.0.
