The MacPorts project is pleased to announce the release of MacPorts v1.4.0.

Change log is at [MacPorts 1.4.0 ChangeLog](https://trac.macports.org/browser/tags/release_1_4_0/base/ChangeLog).
Downloads are available at [MacPorts 1.4.0 downloads](https://trac.macports.org/browser/downloads/MacPorts-1.4.0).

Thanks to all project members who contributed to this release, and especially to Juan Manuel Palacios, who served as release manager. Bugs may be filed at the [MacPorts bug reports](https://www.macports.org/?page_id=8) page.

We plan to release a v1.4.1 within weeks with some ongoing enhancements. Please note that our official plan is to build disk images only for 1.x.0 releases, and let subsequent point releases selfupdate from there. Note also that if you have a previous release of MacPorts installed, the easiest path to MacPorts 1.4.0 is simply "sudo port selfupdate".
