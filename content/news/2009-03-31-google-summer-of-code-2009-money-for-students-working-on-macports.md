Summer of Code is a annual program hold by Google to attract new developers for the open source world. You work on a open source project over the summer and earn $4500 USD.

It is a great opportunity for college students to get a real, on the ground programming experience, work on an exciting open source project with mentoring from its developers. MacPorts has great tasks on the ideas page that could use attention, and still has slots for volunteers. Get in contact with us and apply if you are interested!

Please also spread the word if you are a MacPorts user and a friend of yours would be qualified. This is a great opportunity not just for the students, but to foster and extend the MacPorts project.

See this wiki page for more information:

Application is still open until April 3, 19:00 UTC. For more details, just contact the [macports-dev](https://lists.macosforge.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/macports-dev) mailing list or any of the mentors.
