MacPorts has long used the maintainer address <darwinports@opendarwin.org> to signify that a port did not have an active maintainer. We have changed this protocol to use two new addresses (<nomaintainer@macports.org> and <openmaintainer@macports.org>). These addresses autorespond with a message referring the reader to <https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SpecialMaintainerAddresses> for more information.
