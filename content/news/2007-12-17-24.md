The MacPorts team is most proud to present to the world its new face at <https://www.macports.org>, after a couple of months long redesign of the old website we had at OpenDarwin servers and which now replaces the default Wordpress portal we were using since our migration to Mac OS Forge.

Coupled to our new webpage is a considerable and on-going facelift to our until unfortunately lacking documentation, our new guide at <https://guide.macports.org>, mostly the work of our own Mark Duling, Boey Maun Suang and Simon Ruderich.

Enjoy them and feel free to give us as much feedback as you may have by following the guidelines in the brand new <https://www.macports.org/contact.php> page.

Kudos to all those who helped make these important milestone happen, keep it up!
