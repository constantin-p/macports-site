The MacPorts Project is pleased to announce the release of version
2.4.2. This is a bugfix release with small changes only. See the
[ChangeLog][1] for the list of changes.

If you already have MacPorts installed, the preferred method for
updating is to run:

`sudo port selfupdate`

For new installs, [package installers][2] are available for the most current
macOS 10.13 High Sierra and all older releases back to OS X 10.4 Tiger. The
source is also available as tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2, or from the
[git tag][3].

Detached PGP signatures for the disk images and package installers have
been made by [Joshua Root][4], while the git tag and source tarballs have
been signed by [Rainer MÃ¼ller][5]. Both public keys are available on the
keyservers and our MacPorts wiki pages, the fingerprints being:

`0x01FF673FB4AAE6CD: C403 7936 5723 6DCF 2E58  0C02 01FF 673F B4AA E6CD`

`0x670191C05C5C6749: 7500 E6A3 6FA5 83B4 071B  B540 6701 91C0 5C5C 6749`
