### Getting Help

If you're looking for help to troubleshoot a particular failure installing or using MacPorts, providing us with as much information about your host platform as you can gather will help us help you in turn to look into the problem. The following simple steps comprise our recommended procedure to obtain support:

1. First and foremost, check the MacPorts [Documentation](https://guide.macports.org/), man pages, [FAQ](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ) and [problems hotlist](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/ProblemHotlist).
2. Second, check the archives of the appropriate mailing list you intend to post to (below) to see if your question has already been asked and dealt with.
3. Finally, if you still haven't found the answer to your problem, send e-mail to the appropriate mailing list with the following information:
  - output generated by the __`port`__ command's `-v` (verbose) or `-d` (debug) flags;
  - platform details such as operating system version (e.g. `10.4.10`), hardware architecture (e.g. Intel or PowerPC), and the version of Xcode installed — the __`sw_vers`__ and __`uname -a`__ commands are of great help in this regard;
  - any third party software that may exist in places such as `/usr/local` and/or `/sw`.


### Public Mailing Lists

The MacPorts Project hosts a number of specialized mailing lists you can freely subscribe to:

- [MacPorts Users](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-users/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-users/)):

    General discussion of MacPorts installation and usage. A moderate volume list.
- [MacPorts Developers](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-dev/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-dev/)):

    Where project members and contributors discuss the MacPorts “base” system itself and future development plans, and related “Portfile” writing best practices. A low volume list.

- [MacPorts Changes](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-changes/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-changes/)):

    Read-only, low to moderate volume list of changes to our [git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/macports/) for both “base” code and Portfiles, among others.

- [MacPorts Builds](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-builds/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-builds/)):

    Read-only, moderate volume list with build notifications from our [Buildbot](https://build.macports.org/).

- [MacPorts Tickets](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-tickets/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-tickets/)):

    Read-only, moderate volume list of ticket activity on our [Trac bug tracker](https://trac.macports.org/).

- [MacPorts Announce](https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-announce/) ([archives](https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-announce/)):

    Read-only, low volume list for project related major announcements.

Note that due to spam control policies you must subscribe to our non read-only lists in order to post to any of them. Members are expected to abide by the very simple [Netiquette guidelines](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855) that are common to most open forums when posting; of particular relevance is sticking to plain text messages, our language of choice (English), and reducing the number and size of attachments in any way possible (e.g, by using paste bins such as [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and passing along the paste URL rather than full error messages).


### Administrative Contact

The private and read-only `macports-mgrat{{< at-sign >}}lists.macports.org` mailing list is where you should send mail to in case you need to get in touch with the The MacPorts Project's [management team](https://guide.macports.org/#project.portmgr) (A.K.A. “PortMgr”), in case you have any administrative request or if you wish to discuss anything you might feel is of private nature (like the interaction between MacPorts and NDA'd software).

This is also where you should turn to if you are a developer and/or a contributor interested in joning The MacPorts Project with full write access to our git repository and Wiki pages, either to work on MacPorts itself or as a ports maintainer. Please read the [documentation available](https://guide.macports.org/#project.membership) on joining for more information.


### Bug Tracker

We use the popular [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) web-based tool for our [bug tracking](https://trac.macports.org/roadmap) and [Wiki](https://trac.macports.org/wiki) needs, thus buying ourselves seamless read-only integration with our git repository through its [source browser](https://trac.macports.org/browser) and the project [timeline](https://trac.macports.org/timeline) (where ticket activity can also be viewed). Note that in order to interact with Trac for anything other than read only operations, you need to [register](https://trac.macports.org/auth/register/) with GitHub for an account.

If you think you've found a bug either in one of our [available ports](https://www.macports.org/ports.php) or in MacPorts itself, or on the other hand if you'd like to make a contribution of any kind to the project, feel free to [open a ticket](https://trac.macports.org/newticket) to help us look into the problem and/or submission. Please keep in mind that we usually get a fairly high number of duplicate reports for common problems and therefore appreciate any help we can get in the process of streamlining our ticket duties. [Searching](https://trac.macports.org/search) the Trac database & mailing list archives (above), and reading our [FAQ](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ) & [problems hotlist](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/ProblemHotlist) to see if your report has already been filed is recommended, as well as reading the [ticketing guidelines](https://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets) that will help you create a better report.

Viewing existing tickets through the facilities offered by predefined and custom [ticket reports](https://trac.macports.org/report) that allow for detailed queries is also available.


### IRC

For a more real-time discussion of any MacPorts related topic, the [`#MacPorts`](irc://chat.freenode.net/#MacPorts) channel on the [Freenode network](http://freenode.net/) is where some of us usually hang out, MacPorts developers and community members alike. Everyone is free and welcomed to join us, even if it is for a random fun conversation or a productive troubleshooting session, but please keep in mind that no one is guaranteed to be around at any particular moment and that channel members are not obligated to answer your questions. If you fail to get any traction at time, do not take it personally and simply direct your questions to the mailing lists instead.

The language of choice for the IRC channel is also English, for obvious reasons of universality, so sticking to it is appreciated.
