This chapter shows you how to install MacPorts and its prerequisites step-by-step. Note that the section about [installing Xcode](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode) is macOS-specific. If you wish to install MacPorts on another platform, first make sure you have a working C compiler installed, skip ahead to [installing MacPorts from source](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source), and continue to the end of the chapter.
