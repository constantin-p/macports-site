MacPorts base upgrades are performed automatically (when a newer release is available) during a [selfupdate](https://guide.macports.org/#using.port.selfupdate) operation. To upgrade a copy of MacPorts that was installed from source to the newer release of the source code, simply repeat the [source install](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source) with the newer version of the MacPorts source code.
