If you are using macOS, you should install MacPorts using the macOS package installer unless you do not wish to install it to {{< docs/path >}}/opt/local/{{< /docs/path >}}, the default MacPorts location, or if you wish to install a pre-release version of MacPorts base. However, if you wish to [install multiple copies of MacPorts](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source.multiple) or install MacPorts on another OS platform, you must [install MacPorts from the source code](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.source).
