__MacPorts is a open-source package manager for MacOS__. It is an easy-to-use system for installing and upgrading open-source software on the [Mac operating system](http://www.apple.com/macos/).

## Getting involved

There are many ways you can get involved with MacPorts and peer users, system administrators & developers alike. Browse over to the “[Contact Us]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md" >}})” section of our site and:

- Explore our [mailing lists]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md#public-mailing-lists" >}}), either if it is for some general user support or to keep on top of the latest MacPorts developments and commits to our software repository.
- Check out our [Support & Development]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md#bug-tracker" >}}) portal for some bug reporting and live tutorials through the integrated Wiki server.
- Or simply come join us for a friendly [IRC]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md#irc" >}}) chat if you wish for more direct contact with the [people behind]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md#individuals" >}}) it all.

If on the other hand you are interested in joining The MacPorts Project in any way, then don't hesitate to contact the project's management team, [“PortMgr”]({{< ref "support/contact-us.md#administrative-contact" >}}), to explain your particular interest and present a formal application. We're always looking for more helping hands that can extend and improve our ports tree and documentation, or take MacPorts itself beyond its current limitations and into new areas of the vast software packaging field.

We're eager to hear from you!

### Students

__Google Summer of Code__ is a program to encourage students' participation in Open Source development and offers a stipend to work on the project with an organization for three months. MacPorts has been participating in the program since 2007!

We are looking for students to join us in making 2019 the best Summer of Code yet.

We have a list of ideas with possible tasks for MacPorts and additional information about the process at [wiki/SummerOfCode](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SummerOfCode). We are always open to new ideas. Research on the idea, draft an initial proposal and get it reviewed.
