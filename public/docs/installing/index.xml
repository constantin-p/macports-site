      <description>MacPorts base upgrades are performed automatically (when a newer release is available) during a selfupdate operation. To upgrade a copy of MacPorts that was installed from source to the newer release of the source code, simply repeat the source install with the newer version of the MacPorts source code.</description>

      <description>Uninstalling MacPorts can be a drastic step, and depending on the issue you are experiencing, you may not need to do so. If you are unsure, ask on the macports-users mailing list first.
If you need to uninstall MacPorts, and port is functioning, first uninstall all the installed ports by running this command in the Terminal:
sudo port -fp uninstall installed All that will be left in your installation prefix now will be files that were not registered to any port.</description>
