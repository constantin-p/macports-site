      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been long since we last publicly announced new team members, and as a result some of them have gone without their deserved welcoming posts, sorry &amp;lsquo;bout that. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly remember which ones were the last publicly announced ones, so rather than sifting through our list of members and older blog posts I&amp;rsquo;ll just post the entire list itself:

      <title>Special Maintainer Addresses migrated to new form</title>
      <link>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/news/16/</link>

      <description>MacPorts has long used the maintainer address darwinports@opendarwin.org to signify that a port did not have an active maintainer. We have changed this protocol to use two new addresses (nomaintainer@macports.org and openmaintainer@macports.org). These addresses autorespond with a message referring the reader to https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SpecialMaintainerAddresses for more information.</description>
