      <title>Install Xcode on OS X 10.9 or Later</title>

      <description>Download the latest version of Xcode from the Apple developer website or get it using the Mac App Store.
Once you have Xcode installed, open a terminal, run xcode-select --install, and click the Install button to install the required command line developer tools. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you see a message telling you the software cannot be installed because it is not currently available from the Software Update Server. This usually means you already have the latest version installed.</description>

      <description>MacPorts is an easy to use system for compiling, installing, and managing open source software. MacPorts may be conceptually divided into two main parts: the infrastructure, known as MacPorts base, and the set of available ports.
A MacPorts port is a set of specifications contained in a Portfile that defines an application, its characteristics, and any files or special instructions required to install it. This allows you to use a single command to tell MacPorts to automatically download, compile, and install applications and libraries.</description>

      <title>The Postflight Script</title>
      <link>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/shell/postflight/</link>

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/shell/postflight/</guid>
      <description>The postflight script automatically sets the PATH variable, and optionally the MANPATH and DISPLAY variables according to the rules described below. If a current shell configuration file exists at installation time it is renamed to “mpsaved_$timestamp”. Those installing MacPorts from source code must modify their environment manually using the rules as a guide.
 Required: PATH variable
This variable is set by the postflight script to prepend the MacPorts executable paths to the current path as shown.</description>

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/macports/binary/</guid>
      <description>The macOS package installer automatically installs MacPorts, sets the shell environment, and runs a selfupdate operation to update the ports tree and MacPorts base with the latest release.
 Download the latest MacPorts-2.5.4-....pkg installer from the releases on GitHub. Here are direct links for the latest versions of macOS:
 macOS 10.14 Mojave:
MacPorts-2.5.4-10.14-Mojave.pkg
 macOS 10.13 High Sierra:
MacPorts-2.5.4-10.13-HighSierra.pkg
 macOS 10.12 Sierra:
MacPorts-2.5.4-10.12-Sierra.pkg
  Double-click the downloaded package installer to perform the default “easy” install.</description>

      <description>Download the latest version of Xcode from the Apple developer website or get it using the Mac App Store.
Xcode 4.3 and later do not automatically install the command line tools, but MacPorts requires them. To install them, open the Xcode application, go to the Preferences window, to the Downloads section, and click the Install button next to Command Line Tools. Be sure to return to this window after every Xcode upgrade to ensure that the command line tools are also upgraded.</description>

      <description>If you installed MacPorts using the package installer, skip this section. To install MacPorts from the source code, follow the steps below.
 Download and extract the MacPorts 2.5.4 tarball. Either do so using your browser and the Finder, or use the given commands in a terminal window. curl -O https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.5.4.tar.bz2 tar xf MacPorts-2.5.4.tar.bz2  Afterwards, perform the commands shown in the terminal window. If you wish to use a path other than /opt/local, follow the instructions for installing multiple copies of MacPorts instead.</description>

      <description>To verify that the file containing the MacPorts variables is in effect, type env in the terminal to verify the current environment settings after the file has been created. Example output for env is shown below.
 Changes to shell configuration files do not take effect until a new terminal session is opened.

      <description>If you installed MacPorts using the package installer, skip this section.
There are times when some may want to run MacPorts from a version newer than the current stable release. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a new feature that you&amp;rsquo;d like to use, or it fixes an issue you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, or you just like to be on the cutting edge. These steps explain how to setup MacPorts for developers, using only Git to keep MacPorts up to date.</description>

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/xcode/snowleopard/</guid>
      <description>If you are using Mac OS X 10.6, there are two branches of Xcode which could be considered to be the latest, 3.2.x and 4.x. Xcode 4 costs money, but Xcode 3 is still available free of charge. There are two options for downloading it:
 Xcode 3.2 - smaller download, but you will need to run Software Update after installing to get the latest version. Note that Apple might at some point discontinue providing these updates via their update servers.</description>

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/macports.upgrade/</guid>
      <description>MacPorts base upgrades are performed automatically (when a newer release is available) during a selfupdate operation. To upgrade a copy of MacPorts that was installed from source to the newer release of the source code, simply repeat the source install with the newer version of the MacPorts source code.</description>

      <description>You can set an environment variable in order to use your favorite text editor with the port edit command.
MacPorts will check MP_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR in this order, allowing you to either use a default editor shared with other programs (VISUAL and EDITOR) or a MacPorts-specific one (`MP_EDITOR).
For example, to use the nano editor, add this line to your bash config:
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano To use the user-friendly GUI editor BBEdit (installation required), add this line:</description>

      <title>Install Multiple MacPorts Copies</title>
      <link>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/macports/source.multiple/</link>

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/macports/source.multiple/</guid>
      <description>Occasionally a MacPorts developer may wish to install more than one MacPorts instance on the same host. Only one copy of MacPorts may use the default prefix /opt/local, so for additional installations use the option --prefix as shown below. It&amp;rsquo;s also recommended to change the applications dir using &amp;ndash;with-applications-dir to avoid conflicts in /Applications/MacPorts. Use --without-startupitems to automatically set startupitem_install no in the new macports.conf, which is required to avoid conflicts in /Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchDaemons.</description>

      <description>If you have an earlier release of Mac OS X, you may download the latest version of Xcode for Mac OS X 10.5 (Xcode 3.0 and Xcode 3.1 Developer Tools) or 10.4 (Xcode 2.4.1 and Xcode 2.5 Developer Tools) from the Apple developer website.
Ensure that those of the following options that are available in the installer for your version of Xcode are selected:

      <guid>https://constantin-p.github.io/macports-site/docs/installing/macports.uninstalling/</guid>
      <description>Uninstalling MacPorts can be a drastic step, and depending on the issue you are experiencing, you may not need to do so. If you are unsure, ask on the macports-users mailing list first.
If you need to uninstall MacPorts, and port is functioning, first uninstall all the installed ports by running this command in the Terminal:
sudo port -fp uninstall installed All that will be left in your installation prefix now will be files that were not registered to any port.</description>

      <description>MacPorts today filed an application with Google for Summer of Code 2007. Summer of Code is a Google-sponsored program under which students work over the summer on an open source project, gaining valuable experience while also contributing important effort to open source projects.
We&amp;rsquo;ll know by March 14 whether our application has been accepted. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up a tracking page at SummerOfCode with more information and a list of potential tasks.</description>

      <title>Special Maintainer Addresses migrated to new form</title>

      <description>MacPorts has long used the maintainer address darwinports@opendarwin.org to signify that a port did not have an active maintainer. We have changed this protocol to use two new addresses (nomaintainer@macports.org and openmaintainer@macports.org). These addresses autorespond with a message referring the reader to https://trac.macports.org/wiki/SpecialMaintainerAddresses for more information.</description>
